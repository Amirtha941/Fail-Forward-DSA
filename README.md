# 🚀 FailForwardDSA

> **"Every rejection is one step closer to mastery."**

This repository documents my **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey — through **real company recruitment test problems**.  
Each problem here is more than code — it’s a reflection of a **lesson learned**, a **pattern identified**, or a **mistake corrected**.

---

## 🎯 Repository Vision

> Turning failures into fuel for growth.

- 🧩 Solve **real-world DSA problems** from company assessments.  
- 🪜 Learn and record **mistakes → insights → optimized solutions**.  
- 🧠 Identify **recurring patterns** and **build intuition**.  
- 📈 Track personal growth from **attempts → rejections → mastery**.

## 🧭 Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `CompanyWise/` | Company-specific folders containing questions, solutions, and reflections. |
| `Notes/` | Consolidated notes on patterns, concepts, and learnings across companies. |

**Example:**
```
CompanyWise/
├── Amazon/
│ ├── problem1.cpp
│ ├── problem2.cpp
│ └── README.md ← contains mistakes, approach, and takeaways
├── Microsoft/
│ ├── problem1.cpp
│ └── README.md
Notes/
├── Arrays.md
├── Graphs.md
└── DynamicProgramming.md
```

## 🧩 For Each Test Attempt

Each company folder will include:
- ✅ **Problem statements & solutions**
- 🧠 **Initial thought process**
- ⚠️ **Mistakes or missed patterns**
- 🔁 **Optimized solution & explanation**
- 💡 **Key takeaway / pattern learned**

---

## 📓 Notes Section

The `Notes/` folder compiles all the **recurring insights**:
- Common patterns (e.g., sliding window, binary search on answer)
- Optimization tricks
- Edge cases to watch for
- Time complexity intuition



---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** C/ C++ / Python (based on test)
- **Focus Areas:** Data Structures, Algorithms, and Problem Solving Patterns
- **Goal:** Build depth in DSA through practical exposure

## 🌱 Philosophy

> “You don’t lose when you fail — you lose when you stop learning.”

This repo is a mirror of growth, documenting not perfection but **progress** — from confusion to clarity, from rejection to resilience.
